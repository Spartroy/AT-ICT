But Ahmad had this amazing way of breaking down complex topics into simple, digestible pieces. The interactive notes were a game-changer - I could actually see how concepts worked rather than just memorizing them. Within 8 weeks, I went from barely passing to achieving an A* in my mock exams. The confidence I gained extends far beyond ICT - I now approach all subjects with a problem-solving mindset.",

My parents were disappointed, and I felt hopeless. Then I found Ahmad and AT-ICT. The first thing that amazed me was how patient Ahmad was. He never made me feel stupid for asking the same question multiple times. The recorded sessions were a lifesaver - I could pause, rewind, and learn at my own pace. The breakthrough came in week 6 when I finally understood how databases work. Suddenly, everything started making sense.

I was struggling badly and my confidence was at an all-time low. Ahmad's approach was different from any teacher I'd had before. He focused on understanding rather than memorization, and he celebrated every small victory.
